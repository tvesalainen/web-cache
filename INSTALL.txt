jar-with-dependencies.jar jar. It's scope in maven is provided and it is easiest
to install to <java-home>/jre/lib/ext directory.

Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files
should be installed.

Bouncy Castle provider can be added in <java-home>/jre/lib/java.security file.
